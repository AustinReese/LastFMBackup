# LastFMBackup

Save all scrobbles from any LastFM user.

*Please note that I have only tested this application on my own LastFM library, errors are likely to occur with other, larger libraries. I encourage you to report these issues or create pull requests with fixes, see more information under [Contributing](#contributing)*

## Installation

Install required libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## <a name="contributing"></a> Contributing
I began this project with the goal of a creating a website that would have customizable visualizations of your LastFM data, but I do not have enough time to write that at the moment. There are lots of potential implementations of this data and I encourage anybody with compelling ideas to create pull requests. All I ask for are descriptive comments as to what you've changed/added and why.
